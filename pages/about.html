      <p>
         Hello there! My name is Antonios, but most people call me Adoni. <br>
         I was born and raised in Queens, from a family of Greek and Italian backgrounds. <br><br>
         When I was a kid, I always loved playing video games, and when I was 13 years old, I started to play games that were on PC (ex: Team Fortress 2, Minecraft, Half-Life, etc.). However, my old ASUS laptop with the integrated graphics of its Intel Core i3 processor was holding me back from playing other titles that were more resource intensive. <br>
         Therefore, I learned how different computer components function and how to put them together to build a desktop gaming PC, which I succeeded in doing when I was 15 years old. <br><br>
         As I was learning how to do this, I came across what I considered to be enlightening and entertaining videos on technology overall. A couple of years later, it was time to start thinking about colleges and with that what kind of area I desired to study. The answer to me was clear that Computer Science would be the perfect choice! <br><br>
         Outside of my passion for technology, I have a strong devotion to Scouting. At the age of 18, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout, and I currently volunteer for my troop as an Assistant Scoutmaster to help guide others towards this same path.
